            JIIT OPTICA, the institute's internationally recognised scientific
            body offers a forum for students to discover new worlds outside of
            the academic curriculum and organises workshops, annual festivals,
            national conferences, alumni gatherings, and educational visits to
            reputable research and development institutions. In order to inspire
            young minds, the club also hosts lectures by illustrious scholar and
            researchers from a variety of subjects. From a newly started student
            chapter with a handful active members, JIIT OPTICA has now evolved
            into a reputable community with commendable social outreach. From
            following the footsteps and walking down the well-trodden path to
            paving it’s very own, JIIT OPTICA has witnessed bliss in it’s own
            making. From conducting technical seminars and workshops to
            organising our flagship event JSCOP, JIIT OPTICA has made a brand of
            its name and with each success our impeccable efforts have set the
            bar high for the next.
